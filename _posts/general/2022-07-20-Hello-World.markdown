Hi,

this is the first post for my blog.
So let me explain why I created yet another blog site..

- **Firstly**, Because I can!
- **Secondly**, I wanted to be able to have my uploaded photographs somewhere clustered and properly displayed. I call them photoessays and you can find them in the [photography](https://rpk.io) section on the left
- **Lastly**, I wanted to keep somewhere interesting stuff related to my day job as a developer. Furthermore posting solutions of interesting problems and challanges might help others.

### So this site is seperated into two topics,
- the first and main one is photography.

> In this section I am going to post chunks of my work as an amatuer photographer.
> **Digital photogrpahy**, **Film photography** (**normal format** and **medium format**), and everything else that falls into my hands over time.
> Also I plan to write some thoughts about photography in general like from where a derive inspiration, and how photography changed my vision.

- the second topic is the one I am doing for living, programming.

> The last 2 years I am an actively Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer, so I will write any interesting stuff I meet on my way of becoming the next billionere CTO (not)

Now if anything else beyond these two topics attract my attention and deserves a mention I would not hesitate to analyse it here.

That's it.
