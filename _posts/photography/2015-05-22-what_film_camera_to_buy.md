There are hundreds of blog posts out there with extended reviews and detailed explanations on which film camera you should buy.

The **only problem** with these blog posts / reviews is that they provide too much information, and analyze many cameras that cover **different needs** and **different budgets**. They tend to be more confusing than helpful.

In this post I will try to recommend some film cameras based on my experience. if you have free time and you are willing to learn some new things you should search for more detailed information for these cameras on the Internet. 

### Why trust me?

Do not trust me! These are my personal choices after two years of involvement with analogue cameras and reading many many articles about them.

### Target group

- Everyone who just entered the world of film photography and do not want to waste money buying equipment that would sell or drop out after a while. 
- The intermediate amateur photographer who is in search for a new film camera. 

There is only one important question: 

### What you are going to shoot?

*Street photography, Landscapes or Portraits ?*  

I am going to split this guide into **3 main sections** based on answering the previous question.
Each section will have **two subsections** based on **budget** with two options each, based on **format** (35mm and Medium Format). 

*Disclaimer:* Having the right lens is as vital as having a good and reliable body. In my choices I don't mention any lenses but they have been taken into account, so be sure that any of the below suggestions offers the proper lenses for each case.
