## **Slow Life - The wait**

When you have **36** or **10** (for my medium format 6x7) frames available you take your time before you decide to shoot.

The procedure when shooting film is something like this:

- Find elements you find visually captivating
- Think every element of the photo. (light, pose, environment)
- Plan (from tones to contrast and from saturation to composition)
- Set carefully every camera parameter
- Be patient and concentrate
- Shoot
- Enjoy the moment

These constraints **foster creativity**, **slow you down** and help to empty your mind of any other thoughts.  

<sup>**Digital photography rewards trial and error whereas film rewards learning and understanding.**</sup>

After the click you have to wait again to finish the roll and to develop the negatives, all that waiting makes you look at your work with more **detachment** and **cognition**.

Technology is wonderful, but using film cameras allows me to forget about chasing the latest and greatest equipment and focus on what really matters in making photographs: **composition**, **atmosphere**, and **emotion**.

## **Surprise - Curiosity**

Yes, thats the second most important reason for me shooting film. I can not describe the feeling...

- ...when I open the tank and see the developed negative.
- ...when I develop a film that I have no idea what is on it and I finally see the forgotten pictures.
- ...when I go to the photo lab to pick up the development of the film. It's like a Birthday present, always!

## **History**

All of my favorite great works by photography masters were taken on film
and when shooting film  I feel like I am experiencing photography the way it is supposed to be.

## **Experimentation**

Multiple exposures, expired films, grain, dust, blur, vintage filters, light leaks, and other imperfections make the result unique and unpredictable.

**...Endless possibilities!**

## **The analogue cameras**

Each camera is different.

I have 6 cameras, all of different ages, styles, and formats. Each one, is different and unique. Each kind of film is also different. You have a world of choices. So analogue photography is never boring! 

I Also like film cameras because:

- They look industrial in their construction 
- They feel solid and real in your hand
- The don't need charging

In my opinion you have to love the camera you're using (for personal work) or there is really no enjoyment in the process of taking photos.

- The medium and large format cameras
    - shooting with 6x6, 6x7 or larger film makes you happy because you can see all these little details that take you beyond the real world.

- The very simple film cameras (just 1 button)
    - it is easy to carry with, and there is no complex settings, just focus on the main subject.
 
Lastly, I do not want to invest a lot of money in equipment that will be obsolete in a very short time. **Film cameras last for decades!**

## **Quality**

Quality of negative/slide. Yes it is neither cheap nor easy procedure until you get a good result but sometimes its better than digital.

With a good medium format camera (600$) and a professional film you can achieve results way better.

- Fantastic bokeh (DOF) and amazing feeling of the representation/rendering of the 3rd dimension (depth)
- Huge raw files when scanned in a good scanner 
- Amazing results on print.

I Also love:

- The thickness and density of shades and shadows
- The dynamic range
    * Film allows me to retain highlight detail (especially when hand printed in a darkroom) even when I deliberately over expose my images for a pre-visualized picture.
- The deep contrast of film
- The smoothness of the grain and the feeling of continuity from the foreground to the background. It has a very organic look and I think nothing can replicate it

## **DIY**

I like the "do it yourself" approach. 
Loading the camera, pushing the film, developing and printing the rolls with my hands.

I love how I don't have to sit in front of the computer for hours editing an image. It looks great right out of the camera.

## **The end**

Film photography is **pure** and **real**, it requires  **patience**, **concentration** and **dedication**. 

And thats why it is the best way to train the eye and refine your technique.
 
With film photography there's a fulfillment in me and a feeling like I'm **doing** something, **creating** something. I am a software engineer and I love my job for the same reason. I create things and I **understand** how things work.
