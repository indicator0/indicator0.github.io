**Photography is not about gears**â€”but gears matter.  
  
To me, [D850](https://www.nikon.se/sv_SE/product/digital-cameras/slr/professional/d850) is the most important one.
As a full-frame 135 DSLR, it satisfies all the performance I need (both photography performance and controlling performance).
F mount provides me with the ability to connect the world most versatile and reliable lens group. From 1950s to now.
