I"<p>Hi,</p>

<p>this is the first post for my blog.
So let me explain why I created yet another blog site..</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Firstly</strong>, Because I can!</li>
  <li><strong>Secondly</strong>, I wanted to be able to have my uploaded photographs somewhere clustered and properly displayed. I call them photoessays and you can find them in the <a href="https://rpk.io">photography</a> section on the left</li>
  <li><strong>Lastly</strong>, I wanted to keep somewhere interesting stuff related to my day job as a developer. Furthermore posting solutions of interesting problems and challanges might help others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-this-site-is-seperated-into-two-topics">So this site is seperated into two topics,</h3>
<ul>
  <li>the first and main one is photography.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this section I am going to post chunks of my work as an amatuer photographer.
<strong>Digital photogrpahy</strong>, <strong>Film photography</strong> (<strong>normal format</strong> and <strong>medium format</strong>), and everything else that falls into my hands over time.
Also I plan to write some thoughts about photography in general like from where a derive inspiration, and how photography changed my vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>the second topic is the one I am doing for living, programming.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last 2 years I am an actively Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer, so I will write any interesting stuff I meet on my way of becoming the next billionere CTO (not)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if anything else beyond these two topics attract my attention and deserves a mention I would not hesitate to analyse it here.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it.</p>
