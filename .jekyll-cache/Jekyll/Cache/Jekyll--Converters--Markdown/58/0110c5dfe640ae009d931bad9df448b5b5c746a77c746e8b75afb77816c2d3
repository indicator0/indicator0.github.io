I"I<p><strong>Photography is not about gears</strong>â€”but gears matter.</p>

<p>To me, <a href="https://www.nikon.se/sv_SE/product/digital-cameras/slr/professional/d850">D850</a> is the most important one.
As a full-frame 135 DSLR, it satisfies all the performance I need (both photography performance and controlling performance).
F mount provides me with the ability to connect the world most versatile and reliable lens group. From 1950s to now.</p>
