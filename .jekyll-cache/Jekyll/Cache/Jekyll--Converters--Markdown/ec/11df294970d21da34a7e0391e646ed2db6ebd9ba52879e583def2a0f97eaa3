I"»"<p>The second most popular question following the <a href="https://rpk.io/posts/why-I-shoot-film">‚ÄúWhy you shoot film?‚Äù</a> is <strong>‚ÄúWhat gear you own and use?‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>So this is the list of all the gear I own and use!</p>

<h2 id="bronica-gs-1"><strong>Bronica GS-1</strong></h2>
<p>with <strong>Zenzanon PG 100mm f/3.5</strong> and <strong>Zenzanon PG 65mm f/4</strong><br />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Bronica%20GS-1%20-%20Zenzanon%20PG%20100mm%20f:3.5%20and%20Zenzanon%20PG%2065mm%20f:4.jpg" alt="Bronica GS-1 - Zenzanon PG 100mm f:3.5 and Zenzanon PG 65mm f:4" /></p>

<p>this is my main camera, the one that I carry with me when I go out to photograph, from landscapes to portraits.</p>

<p>I am very happy with the camera as it produces very good results,
it has good metering with the AE prism and sharp lenses.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong>
<em>Focusing improved dramatically when I changed the regular focusing screen with a split-screen. I recommend this upgrade to anyone with a GS-1.</em></p>

<p>The built quality is also very good, solid with good ergonomics which makes the use of the camera pretty easy.</p>

<p>The <strong>Zenzanon PG</strong> series of lenses are excellent, sharp across the field even when wide open and can be found in very reasonable prices.</p>

<p>Due to my work style (<a href="https://rpk.io/photo_essays/on_the_road/">urban landscapes</a>) I mostly use the <em>PG 65mm</em> and whenever I shoot portraits I use the <em>100mm</em> one.</p>

<p>The only weakness of the lenses is that they are a bit slow (3.5) and they don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù in their bokeh.</p>

<p>Many people say that the GS1 is light and compact for a 6x7 SLR but I can‚Äôt even imagine how other 6x7 SLRs are, because for me this one feels <strong>monstrous</strong></p>

<p>I use mine with AE prism and the speedgrip which clearly adds extra weight and size but improves dramatically the handling and use of the camera.</p>

<p>Conclusion: 
Bronica GS-1 is <strong>the best 6x7 SLR</strong> you can get in this price range (600$ with 2 lenses in 2015)
You get <strong>amazing results</strong> if you know how to use it, <strong>large negatives</strong>, <strong>awesome lenses</strong>, <strong>many accessories</strong> and the ability to select between <strong>different formats (6X6, 645)</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="contax-g1"><strong>Contax G1</strong></h2>
<p>with <strong>Contax G Zeiss 28mm f/2.8 Biogon</strong>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Contax%20G1%20-%20Contax%20G%20Zeiss%2028mm%20f:2.8%20Biogon.jpg" alt="Contax G1 - Contax G Zeiss 28mm f:2.8 Biogon" /></p>

<p>This is a new arrival to fill the gap of a small, quality 35mm camera that I will carry with me as a backup to the medium format.</p>

<p>I used to have an Olumpus XA2 for this job but its constraints led me to search for a better one.</p>

<p>I found the Contax G1 in a bargain and bought it, I don‚Äôt need to say much about the Contax G system, it is <strong>one of the best 35mm systems</strong> you can find out there. <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/contax/g-system.htm">Ken Rockwell Review</a></p>

<p>The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is that eventually it is not going to be a replacement of the Olympus XA2. Its bigger, heavier and feels more fragile. I carry the XA2 everywhere inside my everyday backpack, something you can‚Äôt do with the precious Contax.</p>

<p>Where I use the Contax:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backup to the Bronica GS-1 in my photography roadtrips</li>
  <li>Main camera in my urban wanderings</li>
  <li>Loaded with black and white film for my <a href="https://rpk.io/photo_essays/roadtrip_snapshots/">black and white projects</a> :)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="olympus-om2n"><strong>Olympus OM2n</strong></h2>
<p>with <strong>Zuiko Auto-W 28mm f/3.5</strong>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20OM2n%20-%20Zuiko%20Auto-W%2028mm%20f:3.5.jpg" alt="Olympus OM2n - Zuiko Auto-W 28mm f:3.5" /></p>

<p>This is a very good camera but I have never used it. Bought it around the same time I bought the Olympus XA2 and maybe thats a good excuse for not using it.</p>

<p>The camera is <strong>very small</strong>, has a <strong>solid build</strong> and a <strong>fantastic viewfinder</strong>. I can not say much about it because I have shot only 3 or 4 films with this one.</p>

<p>Someone could say that with the entry of the Contax G1 this camera became obsolete, but I don‚Äôt think so, the Contax is an AF rangefinder with expensive lenses and accessories when the <strong>OM2n</strong> is a classic manual focus SLR with a <strong>huge selection of good and affordable lenses</strong>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if I will ever shoot actively with it but I will not sell it for the following 3 reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is my only 35mm SLR camera</li>
  <li>It is not worth a lot of money</li>
  <li>It is one of the best looking SLRs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="olympus-xa2"><strong>Olympus XA2</strong></h2>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20XA2.jpg" alt="Olympus XA2" /></p>

<p>This is one of my favorites cameras. Why? Because I have it with me all the time!</p>

<p><strong>XA2</strong> comes in a tiny clamshell body with an awesome, sharp, contrasty little Zuiko 35mm 1:3.5 4-element lens.</p>

<p>It offers <strong>automatic exposure</strong> and <strong>zone focusing</strong>. This means that the only thing you can control is the focus zones which are splited in three groups: close (1.2m-1.8m), near (1.2-6.3m) and far (6.3m-infinity).</p>

<p>This focusing system is one of the biggest disadvantages in my opinion, I have many out of focus images and with their mediocre quality these images are unusable.</p>

<p>Overall this is my favorite take-everywhere film camera and responsible for this great set: <a href="https://rpk.io/photo_essays/roadtrip_snapshots/">Roadtrip Snapshots</a></p>

<h2 id="olympus-omd-em-5"><strong>Olympus OMD EM-5</strong></h2>
<p>with <strong>M.Zuiko 12-50mm f/3.5-6.3 ED</strong> and <strong>Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7</strong>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpk0/rpk_site/gh-pages/images/posts/my_gear/Olympus%20OMD%20EM-5%20-%20LUMIX%20G%2020mm%20f:1.7%20and%20M.Zuiko%2012-50mm.jpg" alt="Olympus OMD EM-5 - LUMIX G 20mm f:1.7 and M.Zuiko 12-50mm" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs 2015, you can‚Äôt live in this year and not have a good digital camera. There are moments where the advantages of a digital camera make it indispensable.</p>

<p><strong>The right tool for the right job.</strong></p>

<p>Trips with friends, events and concerts are some occasions where I bring the <strong>OMD</strong> with me.
This <strong>amazingly build little camera</strong> produces very good images and has these 4 fantastic features that I love:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Small size (with the 20mm Panasonic fits in your jacket pocket)</li>
  <li>Weather sealing (many new opportunities emerge)</li>
  <li>5-axis image stabilization
    <ul>
      <li>Helps shoot in low light (1/4 sec its an easy shoot)</li>
      <li>You can easily mount and play with older lenses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fast autofocus with most Micro Four Thirds lenses</li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus point: <strong>It‚Äôs beautiful!</strong> :)</p>

<p>I will upgrade this camera when I found the same package with better ISO performance and maybe a full frame sensor.</p>

<h2 id="holga-120cfn-6x6-smena-symbol-35mm"><strong>Holga 120CFN (6x6), Smena Symbol 35mm</strong></h2>

<p>Double exposures, light leaks and unexpected results. It is so much fun to use these two plastic cameras!</p>
