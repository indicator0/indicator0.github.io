<p>When you have <strong>36</strong> or <strong>10</strong> (for my medium format 6x7) frames available you take your time before you decide to shoot.</p>

<p>The procedure when shooting film is something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find elements you find visually captivating</li>
  <li>Think every element of the photo. (light, pose, environment)</li>
  <li>Plan (from tones to contrast and from saturation to composition)</li>
  <li>Set carefully every camera parameter</li>
  <li>Be patient and concentrate</li>
  <li>Shoot</li>
  <li>Enjoy the moment</li>
</ul>

<p>These constraints <strong>foster creativity</strong>, <strong>slow you down</strong> and help to empty your mind of any other thoughts.</p>

<p><sup><strong>Digital photography rewards trial and error whereas film rewards learning and understanding.</strong></sup></p>

<p>After the click you have to wait again to finish the roll and to develop the negatives, all that waiting makes you look at your work with more <strong>detachment</strong> and <strong>cognition</strong>.</p>

<p>Technology is wonderful, but using film cameras allows me to forget about chasing the latest and greatest equipment and focus on what really matters in making photographs: <strong>composition</strong>, <strong>atmosphere</strong>, and <strong>emotion</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="surprise---curiosity"><strong>Surprise - Curiosity</strong></h2>

<p>Yes, thats the second most important reason for me shooting film. I can not describe the feeling‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚Ä¶when I open the tank and see the developed negative.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶when I develop a film that I have no idea what is on it and I finally see the forgotten pictures.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶when I go to the photo lab to pick up the development of the film. It‚Äôs like a Birthday present, always!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h2>

<p>All of my favorite great works by photography masters were taken on film
and when shooting film  I feel like I am experiencing photography the way it is supposed to be.</p>

<h2 id="experimentation"><strong>Experimentation</strong></h2>

<p>Multiple exposures, expired films, grain, dust, blur, vintage filters, light leaks, and other imperfections make the result unique and unpredictable.</p>

<p><strong>‚Ä¶Endless possibilities!</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-analogue-cameras"><strong>The analogue cameras</strong></h2>

<p>Each camera is different.</p>

<p>I have 6 cameras, all of different ages, styles, and formats. Each one, is different and unique. Each kind of film is also different. You have a world of choices. So analogue photography is never boring!</p>

<p>I Also like film cameras because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They look industrial in their construction</li>
  <li>They feel solid and real in your hand</li>
  <li>The don‚Äôt need charging</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion you have to love the camera you‚Äôre using (for personal work) or there is really no enjoyment in the process of taking photos.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The medium and large format cameras
    <ul>
      <li>shooting with 6x6, 6x7 or larger film makes you happy because you can see all these little details that take you beyond the real world.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The very simple film cameras (just 1 button)
    <ul>
      <li>it is easy to carry with, and there is no complex settings, just focus on the main subject.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I do not want to invest a lot of money in equipment that will be obsolete in a very short time. <strong>Film cameras last for decades!</strong></p>

<h2 id="quality"><strong>Quality</strong></h2>

<p>Quality of negative/slide. Yes it is neither cheap nor easy procedure until you get a good result but sometimes its better than digital.</p>

<p>With a good medium format camera (600$) and a professional film you can achieve results way better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fantastic bokeh (DOF) and amazing feeling of the representation/rendering of the 3rd dimension (depth)</li>
  <li>Huge raw files when scanned in a good scanner</li>
  <li>Amazing results on print.</li>
</ul>

<p>I Also love:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The thickness and density of shades and shadows</li>
  <li>The dynamic range
    <ul>
      <li>Film allows me to retain highlight detail (especially when hand printed in a darkroom) even when I deliberately over expose my images for a pre-visualized picture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The deep contrast of film</li>
  <li>The smoothness of the grain and the feeling of continuity from the foreground to the background. It has a very organic look and I think nothing can replicate it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diy"><strong>DIY</strong></h2>

<p>I like the ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù approach. 
Loading the camera, pushing the film, developing and printing the rolls with my hands.</p>

<p>I love how I don‚Äôt have to sit in front of the computer for hours editing an image. It looks great right out of the camera.</p>

<h2 id="the-end"><strong>The end</strong></h2>

<p>Film photography is <strong>pure</strong> and <strong>real</strong>, it requires  <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>concentration</strong> and <strong>dedication</strong>.</p>

<p>And thats why it is the best way to train the eye and refine your technique.</p>

<p>With film photography there‚Äôs a fulfillment in me and a feeling like I‚Äôm <strong>doing</strong> something, <strong>creating</strong> something. I am a software engineer and I love my job for the same reason. I create things and I <strong>understand</strong> how things work.</p>
